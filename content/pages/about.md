**About this Blog**

The Art of Software has evolved significantly over the past twenty years I have been working as a software engineer.

We stand at a junction where we have seen numerous step changes in our technology stacks:

* Information is more available than it has ever been before - the advent of **Software-As-A-Service**  and the **API economy** allows us to incorporate sophisticated capabilities within our software in days instead of months.
* **Cloud computing** provides us with unprecedented access to computing power democratizing innovation by facilitating the smallest startups to run-up infrastructure at insanely low costs through to providing the vast compute that powers powerful artificial intelligence systems such as virtual assistants or self-driving cars.
* Increased range of HCI - smart phones; virtual reality; augmented
* Continuous improvements to SDLC ... CI/CD; Testing.........................
* 

During my career, I have seen a revolution in the way in which we develop software - working in an industry where the only thing that is certain is change. Yet we are still trying to figure it out - how can we effectively deliver quality software in every shorter timespans.
