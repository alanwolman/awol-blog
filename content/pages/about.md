**About Me**



**About this Blog**

The Art of Software has evolved significantly over the past twenty years I have been working as a software engineer.

We stand at a junction where we have seen numerous step changes in our technology stacks:

* Information is more available than it has ever been before - the advent of **Software-As-A-Service**  and the **API economy** allows us to incorporate sophisticated capabilities within our software in days instead of months.
* **Cloud computing** provides us with unprecedented access to computing power democratizing innovation by facilitating the smallest startups to run-up infrastructure at insanely low costs through to providing the vast compute that powers powerful artificial intelligence systems such as virtual assistants or self-driving cars.
* **Serverless** frameworks and **containers** provide us with the means to more cost-effectively and reliably scale our environments.
* Technology is ever-present - with an ever-increasing range of ways of interacting with technology - Internet of Things; smart phones; wearables; virtual reality; augmented reality
* Software development practices have reached a level of maturity that allow us to develop quality code more efficiently and techniques such as **automated testing** and **CI/CD** are now table stakes for a professional software engineer.

During my career, I have seen a revolution in the way in which we develop software - working in an industry where the only thing that is certain is change. Yet we are still trying to figure it out - how can we effectively deliver quality software in every shorter timespans.

As CTO for MyDNA - a small biotech startup I spend a lot of time assessing new tools techniques and methodologies to ensure we remain agile and can deliver a great experience for our customers. This blog will allow me to share some of my problems; solutions; experiences and learnings - I look forward sharing my journey with you.
