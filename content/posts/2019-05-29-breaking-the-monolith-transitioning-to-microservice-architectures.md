  Transitioning from a monolithic application to a microservices architecture
  can have a transformative impact on an organisation - but the journey is
  filled with potential pitfalls. This series of posts provides an overview of
  some of the issues faced when breaking a monolithic architecture and discusses
  some approaches to smoothing the transition to a microservices / "distributed
  monolith" architecture.

## Will microservices benefit my organisation

Microservices provide a significant number of benefits to organisations that can overcome the initial hurdles associated with the adoption of microservices.The benefits of microservices may include:

* Increased developer productivity The scale of large monolithic applications provides a major impediment to developers - this can impact development productivity in a number of ways:
  * Understanding a given piece of functionality can be quite daunting for new developers who need to work on a small function within the system.
  * Build times and load times for the application tend to be larger as the entire monolith must be built in order to work on the functionality impacting the developer.
  * Releases tend to be large and may impact a wide cross-section of functionality,
* Flexibility of technology choice
* Independent components allow for more flexibility with release schedules
* Easier to scale
* Autonomous teams
